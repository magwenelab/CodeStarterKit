# Setup guide for VSCode recommended extensions and VSCode Remote-SSH

## Install VSCode

Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and choose the appropriate installer for your platform.

## Install VSCode Remote-SSH extensions

Go to the Extensions tab in the left panel icons (or Ctrl + Shift + X) and search for and install Remote-SSH. 
This will automatically install these other extensions: Remote Explorer nad Remote-SHH: Editing Configuration Files.
In the left panel, in the Remote Explorer icon you can connect to a new remote server. If you follow the steps in [ssh_keys.md](https://github.com/magwenelab/CodeStarterKit/blob/main/ssh_keys.md) 
you will se the nickname of your server as an option, select it and the connection should be automatic.  
If you didn't set up a nickname you can use the full ssh command and follow the prompts to connect and add you password.  

## Install other VSCode extensions

If you need the extensions in the local machine and in the remote server you will need to install them twice. 
You need to have the remote conection active to install them remotely.    
You can search for them in the Extensions explorer in the left panel.

I recommend the following basic extensions that don't need any configuration:  

* Rainbow CSV
* Edit CSV (Not necessary if you will use Data Wrangler, which is better. See Python extensions below)  
* Path Intellisense  
* Preview  
* SVG Previewer
